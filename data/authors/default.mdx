Welcome to the Homvas (Home/Canvas) of Zak El Fassi—where the essence of being perpetually curious meets the relentless pursuit of intertwining humanity with technology. This isn't just a blog; it's a chronicle of a journey through the digital and physical realms, curated by a soul that refuses to be confined by the conventional.

Before Zak dove into the corporate world, his teenage years and early twenties were spent at the helm of Concep.ma, a cradle for digital innovation that birthed some of the first interactive digital social experiences online in the early 2000s. Think of PeaceAndLol, a pioneering social media photo-sharing product, or WannaJo.in, a collaborative social planning service that catapulted social products to new heights in emerging markets. During this period, the likes of Facebook and Twitter were setting up shop in Silicon Valley. These were not just projects; they were Zak's early rebellions against the digital status quo that would eventually happen, setting the stage for what was to become a life dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Zak's narrative continued beyond groundbreaking digital experiences. After refining his craft and obtaining his Master of Science in Computer Science, he joined Google in 2012 as a webmaster intern, a stint that saw him learn, build, and evangelize. Yet, his heart beat for more—more creation, more innovation, more exploration. This insatiable curiosity led him to found Zaigood Labs, a sanctuary for experimental frontier technology with a mission to bring humanity and technology closer together. Here, in the San Francisco Bay Area, Zak continues to write, consult, invest, and advise, sharing his previous failures with startups to help them think differently.

But who is Zak El Fassi, really? Beyond the entrepreneur, beyond the engineer, beyond the visionary lies a rebel at heart who finds solace and expression in the act of writing. To him, writing is not just a form of expression—it's an act of rebellion, a means to free our brains and, ultimately, ourselves. It's in this space of unbounded creative expression that Zak truly comes alive, challenging us to look beyond the surface to dive deep into the essence of our digital and physical existence.

Zak's kitchen is another realm where creativity knows no bounds. Here, amidst the aromatic spices and flavors of Moroccan cuisine, he finds another expressive outlet. Cooking, much like his writing and his work, is an art form—a way to connect, share, and experience the richness of life.

This blog, revived multiple times over the past decade, stands as a testament to Zak's evolving journey. It's a brain dump, a repository of curiosities, learnings, and reflections. From the interconnectedness of trees to the complexities of technology systems and organizational dynamics, Zak's driver in life has been his insatiable curiosity. Building, teaching, mentoring—each is a path to learning, a way to quench his thirst for knowledge.

Zak El Fassi is not just the founder of Zaigood Labs or a former head of product partnerships at Meta. He's a mentor, a builder, a teacher, and, above all, a curious soul whose life's work is a canvas painted with strokes of innovation, creativity, and an unyielding pursuit of understanding the world around us.

So, welcome to zakelfassi.com, where every post, every story, and every reflection is an invitation to embark on this journey of curiosity, creativity, and rebellion against the mundane. Here, we build not just technology but bridges between worlds, between humanity and the digital frontier. Join us, and let's explore the limitless possibilities together.
