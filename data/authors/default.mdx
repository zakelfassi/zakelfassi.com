Welcome to the digital realm of Zak El Fassiâ€”where curiosity meets technology, and the boundaries of reality are constantly challenged. This space is more than a blog; it's a journey through the digital and physical realms, curated by a mind that refuses to be confined by convention.

Zak's journey began with Concep.ma, a cradle for digital innovation that birthed pioneering social experiences like PeaceAndLol and WannaJo.in in the early 2000s. These projects were Zak's early forays into pushing the boundaries of digital interaction, setting the stage for a life dedicated to exploring the possible.

After refining his craft and obtaining his Master of Science in Computer Science, Zak's path led him through tech giants like Google and Meta, where he served as Head of Product Partnerships. Yet, his heart yearned for more creation, more innovation, more exploration.

Today, Zak stands at the forefront of Reality Engineering, bridging the gap between technology, philosophy, and consciousness. As the founder of Zaigood Labs, he continues to experiment with frontier technologies, bringing humanity and technology closer together. Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Zak writes, consults, invests, and advises, sharing his insights to help others think differently.

But who is Zak El Fassi, really? Beyond the entrepreneur and engineer lies a rebel at heart who finds solace in writing. To him, writing is an act of rebellion, a means to free our brains and, ultimately, ourselves. It's in this space of unbounded creative expression that Zak truly comes alive, challenging us to look beyond the surface and dive deep into the essence of our digital and physical existence.

This blog, revived multiple times over the past decade, stands as a testament to Zak's evolving journey. It's a brain dump, a repository of curiosities, learnings, and reflections. From the interconnectedness of trees to the complexities of technology systems and organizational dynamics, Zak's driver in life has been his insatiable curiosity.

Currently, Zak is focused on his most ambitious project yet: "#InformationBeings," a deep dive into myth-information and reality engineering in the Holoverse. This work promises to redefine our understanding of information, consciousness, and the nature of reality itself.

So, welcome to zakelfassi.com, where every post, every story, and every reflection is an invitation to embark on this journey of curiosity, creativity, and rebellion against the mundane. Here, we explore the frontiers where code meets consciousness, unraveling the Holoverse and redefining our digital existence. Join us as we venture into the limitless possibilities of Reality Engineering and beyond.
