Friends –

my online avatar has been quieter than usual these past three months, but for good reason. while recovering from surgery (and a near-death experience), i've been pouring my energy into a new project—slightly unusual from everything i've done so far.

**A BOOK!**

Current working title: "Information Beings: Navigating Myth-Information in the Holoverse"

it's also been an interesting experience of constantly asking "_is there anything else that hasn't been said already or that AI can't just generate?!_"

excited to share more soon!
