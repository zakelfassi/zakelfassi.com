# How Long Is Too Long?

One existential journey I've embarked upon lately revolves around the concept of the "present moment," particularly those moments we share with others. In our hyper-connected world, some of these shared experiences become permanently etched into the digital fabric—manifesting as online spaces, forums, and group chats. Others vanish once they've concluded, leaving behind little more than an addition to our lists of followers or friends.

Before the digital revolution and modern communication tools, such groups could only exist within the confines of familial ties or the workplace—situations where physical proximity and daily interactions intertwined our lives in multiple ways. Looking at macro-group dynamics through the lens of information preservation reveals an intriguing shift: what once was family and later became work teams has now, in the post-2020 era, transformed into group chats and online communities.

Yet, it seems none of these modern communities are built with the understanding that they might eventually need to dissolve and blend back into the background. If they don't, the very nature of individual existence risks becoming stagnant, trapped within static constructs. I perceive the roles of families, workplaces, and other human organizations as mechanisms for generating information—a means to extend the present moment. Whether it's a meeting among colleagues, a chaotic family gathering, or a lively discussion at a high school cafeteria table, these interactions produce information and prolong moments that ultimately shape our personal information pathways and worldly perspectives.

But so what? Recognizing this pattern prompts a crucial question: **How can we redesign these systems to better serve us?**

When I observe social media today, I see an era akin to the Stone Age, on the cusp of discovering fire, unaware that the solution has been within reach all along. The answer, as simple as it may seem, lies in reimagining our information pathways to be more information-forward. We need channels that serve the individual and their purpose—not just in their current life phase but throughout their entire journey—helping them navigate the world and its myriad possibilities in ways that are genuinely beneficial to them, rather than primarily serving the architects of these systems.

**The Impermanence of Digital Connections**

The digital age has exponentially expanded our ability to connect, yet it has also introduced complexities in how we maintain and dissolve these connections. The permanence of digital interactions can be both a blessing and a burden. On one hand, we can revisit past conversations, relive shared experiences, and keep relationships alive across distances and time zones. On the other, the inability to let go of outdated or no longer relevant connections can clutter our mental and emotional spaces, hindering personal growth.

Moreover, the design of current social platforms often emphasizes engagement over meaningful interaction. Algorithms prioritize content that keeps us scrolling, clicking, and sharing, often at the expense of our well-being. This design serves the platform creators more than the users, trapping us in cycles of consumption rather than fostering genuine connection or personal development.

**Reimagining Information Pathways**

Reimagining our information pathways means taking control back from these external influences. It involves being intentional about the communities we join, the conversations we engage in, and the content we consume. It requires platforms that prioritize user agency, privacy, and the facilitation of meaningful interactions over mere engagement metrics.

One possible solution I've been exploring (more soon!) is the development of decentralized networks that allow individuals to form and dissolve groups organically, without the constraints imposed by current social media giants. These networks would prioritize the quality of connections over quantity, enabling users to build relationships that enrich their lives and align with their personal goals and values.

In practice, this might look like platforms offering greater customization, where users can tailor their experience to suit their needs at different life stages. Features could include ephemeral groups that dissolve after serving their purpose, tools for managing digital clutter (_I've been pushing for a "mass unfriend" feature on Facebook for ages_), and interfaces that encourage mindful engagement rather than endless scrolling.

**Our Immediate Responsibility**

Until such a vision materializes, our immediate responsibility is to curate our own information networks—both inputs and outputs—in a manner that preserves and extends the moments and connections that matter. Ideally, these are the moments and relationships others also wish to sustain, creating a collective willingness to continue until we mutually decide otherwise.

We can start by:

- **Mindful Consumption**: Being selective about the content we consume and the platforms we use, choosing those that align with our values and contribute positively to our lives.
- **Intentional Interaction**: Engaging in conversations and communities that foster growth, learning, and genuine connection, rather than superficial engagement.
- **Digital Decluttering**: Regularly reassessing our online relationships and memberships, letting go of those that no longer serve us or have become stagnant.
- **Advocating for Change**: Supporting and contributing to the development of new platforms and technologies that prioritize user well-being over profit.

**Embracing the Fluidity of Connections**

So, how long is too long? Perhaps it's when a connection or a community no longer contributes to our growth or well-being. Recognizing when to let go is just as important as knowing when to hold on. While navigating the digital landscape, we can create and participate in spaces that not only extend our present moments but also enrich them, paving the way for a more intentional and fulfilling existence.

By embracing the impermanence of certain connections and the fluidity of our social landscapes, we allow ourselves to evolve. This evolution is not just personal but collective, influencing how society at large interacts and progresses. It's about transforming our digital experiences from mere placeholders of time to meaningful extensions of our lives.

**Looking Forward**

I'm excited about exploring and contributing to these solutions—experimenting with building platforms and communities that embody these principles. There's much more to say and do, and I hope to "delve" deeper into this journey soon.

In the meantime, I'll let you retake ownership of your information pathways. You are the architect of your digital experiences, crafting them to reflect not just who you are, but who you aspire to be. I believe we can move beyond the Stone Age of social media, discovering the "fire" that's been within our grasp all along.
