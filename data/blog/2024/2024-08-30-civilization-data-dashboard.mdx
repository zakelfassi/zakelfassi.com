Not sure why I took a video break on the internet since 2016, but here we are live again in 2024.

## Cursor AI-Powered Live Coding for Civilization Data: Coding the Past, Visualizing History

This video is anunscripted adventure at the intersection of metaphysics, philosophy, AI, and technology. Our mission? To transform historical civilization data into a captivating interactive dashboard.

### What to Expect

I use cutting-edge AI tools like CursorAI, Claude Sonnet 3.5, and ChatGPT 4o, alongside advanced visual rendering frameworks, to breathe life into raw CSV data. This journey offers a unique perspective on the rise and fall of civilizations throughout history.

But this isn't just about data visualizationâ€”it's a window into the rapidly evolving world of software engineering, where AI is reshaping how we approach complex tasks.

### Key Highlights:

- Witness the power of AI in accelerating data processing and visualization
- Explore the challenges and triumphs of creating an interactive civilization timeline
- Gain insights into past prosperity and societal patterns
- Discover innovative Excel techniques for data manipulation, and how they compare to building custom tools with AI
- Learn about advanced data visualization methods and their AI-powered future

### A Glimpse into the Future

This video pushes the boundaries of what's possible when human creativity meets artificial intelligence. It offers a glimpse into the future of how we understand and interact with historical data and beyond.

### Open-Sourcing the Project

I'll be open-sourcing this project soon, and currently working on ironing out some bugs and software kinks to make it more accessible to a wider audience of researchers and enthusiasts.

### A Note on Audio Quality

As these things often go, I recorded the first few minutes with the wrong microphone. The sound quality improves as the video progresses, and hopefully this is one and done.

Whether you're a tech enthusiast, a history buff, or simply curious about the future of human-AI collaboration, this exploration offers something for everyone. So grab your favorite beverage, settle in, and join me on this exciting journey through time, data, and technology!
