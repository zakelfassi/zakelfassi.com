In the ever-evolving landscape of media and communication, political campaigns have long served as harbingers of technological and social shifts. As the 2024 U.S. presidential race unfolds, it's becoming increasingly clear that candidates' strategies are not just shaping political discourse but also offering us a glimpse into the future of how we'll communicate and consume information.

## The Digital Guerrilla: Trump's Unorthodox Approach

Consider the stark contrast between Donald Trump's approach and that of his opponents. Trump, with his own Truth social network and penchant for long-form, seemingly unscripted podcast appearances—like his recent interview [on the Lex Fridman podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCbfTN-caFI)—is waging what could be described as a guerrilla war in the digital jungle. On the other hand, his primary opponent, Kamala Harris, largely adhere to traditional communication boundaries—relying on conventional interviews and curated social media releases.

This dichotomy isn't just about personal preference; it reflects broader trends in media consumption and public engagement. As Trump succinctly put it in his conversation with Fridman:

> "You have to find out what people are doing, what they're watching, and you have to get it. You have to get on."

This adaptive approach to communication channels is reminiscent of past political innovators who leveraged emerging technologies to their advantage—from FDR's fireside chats to JFK's televised debates.

## Authenticity in the Age of AI

In a world where generative AI accelerates content creation and online avatars proliferate, Trump ensures his physical persona remains tangible by making the rounds on podcasts with hosts who are more familiar to people than traditional TV anchors. This strategy maintains a sense of authenticity and human connection in an increasingly digital landscape. As I've previously explored in ["The Internet's Creative Constraints: Reclaiming Our Digital Legacy"](https://zakelfassi.com/blog/2024/2024-09-02-the-internets-creative-constraints-reclaiming-our-digital-legacy), this approach to digital communication reflects a broader need to reclaim our digital presence in an era of platform dependence.

The content and style of communication are equally crucial. Trump's emphasis on "getting the word out" and "using sense" to anticipate trends speaks to a larger shift towards authenticity and immediacy in public discourse. This approach, although controversial, resonates with a significant portion of the electorate who feel alienated by traditional political rhetoric.

Moreover, the blurring lines between online narratives and real-world events—as exemplified by Trump's references to incidents in Colorado as picked up and amplified on X—highlight the increasing interconnectedness of our digital and physical realities. This phenomenon is something I've explored in depth in my book "Information Beings," where I posit that we are evolving into entities that exist as much in the realm of information as in the physical world. This concept aligns with ideas I've discussed in ["The Identity-Action Nexus: Navigating the Post-AI Information Deluge"](https://zakelfassi.com/blog/2024/2024-08-21-identity-action-nexus), where I examine how our digital identities shape our online actions in an AI-driven world.

## Shifting Societal Norms

The evolving landscape of political communication also reflects broader societal shifts. Trump's openness to discussing topics such as cannabis legalization and the potential benefits of psychedelics signals a change in how traditionally taboo subjects are being integrated into mainstream political discourse. This willingness to engage with evolving social norms could be seen as a leading indicator of future policy directions and public attitudes.

Interestingly, amidst all this technological and social change, there's a concurrent call for a return to traditional values. Trump's assertion that "without religion, there are no guardrails" and his desire to see a resurgence of religion in America might seem at odds with his embrace of new media. However, it could be interpreted as a recognition of the need for shared ethical frameworks in an increasingly fragmented information landscape—a theme that resonates with the concept of "alignment" in AI ethics discussions.

## The Future of Communication

Looking to the future, it's clear that the strategies employed in political campaigns today will likely become the norm in broader communication contexts tomorrow. The ability to navigate multiple platforms, engage in long-form discussions, and maintain authenticity while adapting to new technologies will be crucial skills not just for politicians but for anyone looking to effectively communicate in our rapidly evolving information ecosystem.

As we continue to explore the nature of our existence as Information Beings in a complex, interconnected Holoverse, political campaigns serve as a valuable lens through which we can anticipate and understand the future of media and communication. These trends can help us better prepare ourselves for the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in our ever-changing information landscape.
