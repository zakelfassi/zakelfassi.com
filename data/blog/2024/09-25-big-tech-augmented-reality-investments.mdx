I opted out of attending Meta Connect this year (held on September 25th and 26th) because the in-person attendance required signing an NDA with clauses that essentially muzzled any future discussions about the company, regardless of whether the information was public or not. Paraphrasing, it felt like agreeing to a perpetual gag order, which didn't sit well with me.

However, with the recent announcements, I can finally dive into my thoughts on Meta's position in the AR space, especially in comparison to Snap, Apple, and others.

## The AR Arms Race: Meta's Orion vs. Snap's Spectacles

Meta [unveiled Orion](https://about.fb.com/news/2024/09/introducing-orion-our-first-true-augmented-reality-glasses/), a prototype AR glass that they tout as the "most advanced AR glasses ever made." It's a sleek device—essentially a normal glass frame that projects information onto a screen, merging the digital and physical worlds seamlessly. For more details on Orion's features and Meta's vision for AR, you can check out their official announcement.

Snap, not to be outdone, announced their own version last week: the [new Spectacles](https://www.spectacles.com/spectacles-24?lang=en-US). Thanks to my friend [Vincent](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vincent-trastour), I had the chance to try them out. While Snap has delivered a device directly into developers' hands (albeit leased), Meta has shared an update on their vision for augmented reality, complementing their existing "Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses."

## The Ray-Ban Partnership: A Strategic Masterstroke

Speaking of Ray-Ban, it's worth pausing to appreciate this partnership. Ray-Ban is owned by Luxottica, the behemoth that dominates the eyewear industry. They're to eyewear what Meta is to social media. Chances are, you're reading this through lenses they've produced—I know I am, courtesy of my Oliver Peoples frames. This collaboration is a strategic masterstroke for Meta, allowing them to seed their devices among the masses without reinventing the frame production or distribution wheel, and focus solely on the techno-parts.

## Meta's AR Strategy: Bridging Physical and Digital Realms

This is where Meta's AR strategy diverges from previous attempts by other tech giants like Google Glass, Microsoft's HoloLens, Apple's Vision Pro, and even Snap. Meta envisions the world already viewed through Luxottica frames, and they're simply enhancing it. The current iteration of the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses offers two primary augmented reality features:

1. Capturing and sharing the real world in digital form (a bridge from physical to digital, or P2D)
2. Augmenting the physical world with generative AI audio narratives through the embedded "Meta AI" assistant

But that's just the first step. By copying the physical world into a digital twin and overlaying it with AI-generated audio, Meta sets the stage for what's next: visual augmentation. Soon, in addition to auditory enhancements, we'll see visual artifacts rendered in real time.

## The Magic of AR: Casting Spells into Reality

Every time I try one of these devices, it's like casting a magic spell into reality. You utter a word or move your hands (and very recently fingertips), and your visual world transforms. Reaching this pivotal moment in AR couldn't have happened without billions—perhaps even trillions—of dollars funneled into research and development by various companies and organizations. It's almost as if the public has voted for their resources to be allocated this way.

## The Societal Vote for Technological Advancement

Who asked for this technology? In a way, we all did. Engagement with all forms of content creation and consumption is skyrocketing. With every event that unfolds—sometimes even every bird that chirps or leaf that falls—there's an Instagram post or story waiting to be shared or viewed.

We're collectively voting to divert our attention in these ways.

## The Double-Edged Sword of Technological Progress

There are undeniable merits to accelerating technological development. We're living in a world burdened by generational problems and grudges. Each passing generation not only hands over the torch to the next but often ensures it's scorching hot... Technological progress might be our best hope for addressing these deep-seated issues–I think it always been, but we somehow manage to botch it each time.

We're at a crossroads where technological advancements are all we have—including the AR glasses that earned me a few glares and stare-downs on the NYC subway. Yet, much of this progress is being vilified, which brings me to my final point.

## The Cycle of Vilification: A Universal Law of Technology

Vilifying technological progress seems to be anchoring itself as a universal law: **Every technology that exists must go through a cycle of vilification at each step of its evolution.**

Fire serves as the quintessential example of this cycle. As the primordial technology, it was initially feared and shunned because of its potential for destruction—burning crops and livestock alike. It took humanity multiple cycles of experimentation to understand and tame fire, ultimately integrating it into the fabric of civilization.

Just as we harnessed fire and later electricity, we're now grappling with silicon-based technologies. We have the choice to rebuild our fractured world as **information beings** or risk becoming isolated within our own minds—**silicone beings** trapped in passive consumption, disconnected from what truly matters.

## Additional Product Strategy Thoughts on AR Developments

Meta's unveiling of the Orion AR glasses at Meta Connect 2024 marks a significant leap in augmented reality. Orion combines multiple breakthrough technologies—micro-LED projectors, waveguide optics, and silicon carbide lenses—all packed into a lightweight, 100-gram frame with a wide field of view. Paired with a wireless compute pack and a neural wristband for intuitive hand and eye tracking, it offers a high degree of interaction without cumbersome hardware.

Orion isn't just a prototype; it's a statement of intent. Meta envisions this device transforming how we interact with digital content, supporting immersive use cases like multitasking with holographic windows, entertainment, and even projecting life-sized holograms of people. By focusing on contextual AI and human-computer interaction, Meta aims to make AR a daily utility rather than a niche gadget.

In contrast, Snap's fifth-generation Spectacles bring their own flavor to the AR space. Powered by Snap OS, these glasses integrate Liquid Crystal on Silicon (LCoS) micro-projectors to overlay digital content onto the real world. With four cameras for spatial tracking and hand gesture control, they offer immersive experiences like interactive gaming (tried it–really impressive) and collaborative content creation. However, at 226 grams and a 45-minute continuous runtime (had to plug them into my macbook's USB-C for a few minutes because of course they were discharged already), they're bulkier and less enduring than Orion. Plus, they're currently available only to developers at a subscription cost, limiting their immediate global impact.

Meta's partnership with Luxottica through the Ray-Ban brand is a game-changer, and if done well, its impact on the world will be unbelievable (good and bad). It provides Meta with unmatched access to global distribution channels, existing brand recognition, and a long missing sense of "style". Through embedding technology into iconic frames, they're making AR not just accessible but fashionable, lowering the barrier to entry for the average consumer. This approach stands in stark contrast to earlier AR efforts, which often felt clunky or were targeted at enterprise users or the typical tech early adopter persona.

The evolution of AR hardware has been remarkable. We've moved from the bulky, enterprise-focused designs of Google Glass and Microsoft's HoloLens to devices that are sleeker and more consumer-friendly and are already having real world impact. Meta's Orion and Snap's Spectacles represent this new generation, emphasizing versatility and seamless integration into daily life. They address many of the usability and accessibility issues that plagued earlier iterations.

## Navigating the Next Phase of Computing

We're witnessing a pivotal moment in technology—a convergence of innovation, consumer readiness, and societal need. Yet, as with all transformative technologies, each will face its cycle of vilification. Acknowledging valid concerns while also recognizing the immense potential for positive impact is essential to navigate this next phase of computing thoughtfully.

Technology isn't inherently good or evil; it's a tool. Like fire, it can destroy or sustain. The responsibility lies in how we choose to wield it. Will we use these advancements to connect more deeply with the world and each other, or will we allow them to isolate us further?

The choice, as always and just like in the Matrix movies, is ours.
